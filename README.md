# CatQuiz
Project url:

This technical test it is a reflection of a Cat Quiz. I have tried to keep simple end to be intuitive but also I have added some fuctionality what I think will be good for user. In this project will be 2 pages, first one will ask the user if is ready for quiz and second page will be the quiz.

# Start Project
 npm start

 
# Additional Features/Improvements Notes:
    I will add a feature what will present some badges in modal were user receive the answer if he answered right or not. I think will be good for user to know what will be the top 3 quality of the breed, such as temperament, calmity and so on.
    Because I tried to focus on fuctionality as much as possible I will leave here some To Do what need to be tackled to have the app done: 
    1: Responsivity
    2: Probably more style arround how is displayed the question.
    3: Testing, I think testing is importing but because it is not required I will not add them now.

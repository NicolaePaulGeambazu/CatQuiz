# CatQuiz
Project url: https://cat-quiz-eight.vercel.app

This technical test is a reflection of a Cat Quiz. I have tried to keep it simple and intuitive, but I have also added some functionality that I think will be good for the user. In this project, there will be 2 pages. The first one will ask the user if they are ready for the quiz, and the second page will be the quiz.

# Start Project
 npm start

 
# Additional Features/Improvements Notes:
   I will add a feature that will present some badges in a modal where the user receives the answer if they answered right or not. I think it will be good for the user to know what the top 3 qualities of the breed are, such as temperament, calmness, and so on. Because I tried to focus on functionality as much as possible, I will leave here some To-Do items that need to be tackled to have the app done:

Responsiveness
Probably more styling around how the question is displayed.
Testing. I think testing is important, but because it is not required, I will not add them now.
